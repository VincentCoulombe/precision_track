# PrecisionTrack Configuration – Parameter Guide ✨

This guide helps you **parametrize PrecisionTrack for any custom animal‑tracking project**.
Follow the step‑by‑step checklist, then consult each section for detailed explanations of every flag.

## 📦 Step‑by‑step guide 🚶‍♂️🛠️📁

1. **Create a folder** under `./settings/` to hold your dataset‑specific config and metadata.
1. **Copy an existing settings file** (e.g. `mice.py` or `ap.py`) into your the same folder and rename it `path_to_your_custom_dataset_settings.py`.
   - Copy‑pasting saves time: you only tweak what differs from the template.
   - Parameters marked **Keep, but do not change unless you know what you are doing** should stay at their default values – they’re universal.

## 🎯 3. Tracking

### 3.0 Runtime setup

- **`tracking_checkpoint`**: Detection's model (either deployed or not) that will actually be used _inside_ the tracker.
- **`pipelined`**: If `True`, detection & association run asynchronously. Speedup the inference.
- **`tracking_batch_size`**: Frames processed per batch. Speedup the inference.
- **`num_tentatives`**: Consecutive hits before a new track is confirmed.
- **`nb_frames_retain`**: Frames to keep a _lost_ track before deletion.
- **`with_validation`**: Enables Tailtag system re-identification. **Requires Tailtags on the frame.**
- **`with_action_recognition`**: Adds an action‑recognition pass to every track.

### 3.1 Stitching & identity management

- **`stitching_algorithm`**: Dict that selects and configures the multi‑view stitching backend.
  - `capped_classes` A dictionnary containing the classes you want to cap and their corresponding values.
  - `beta`, `match_thr` etc. fine‑tune matching cost and thresholds. Can be adjusted for better performances. You can actually visualize the search-zones with the visualization tool.

### 3.2 Validation (optional)

When `with_validation = True`:

- **`validator`**: Dictionary describing ArUco detection hyper‑parameters. They can be tuned for better performances. Please refer to the [Tailtag publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.07.622536v1) for details.
  - `valid_tags`: the list of the ArUco tag ids visible in the recordings.
  - `timeout_after`: Max seconds per frame before giving up tag detection. **Keep, but do not change unless you know what you are doing.**

### 3.3 Threshold tuning utility

- **`low_thr_range`**, **`high_thr_range`**, **`init_thr_range`**: Candidate grids scanned during tracking hyper‑parameter search. **Keep, but do not change unless you know what you are doing.**

### 3.4 Benchmark testing

- **`hyperparams`**: JSON file storing the tuned thresholds. The file is generated during the ./tools.deploy.py script execution.
- **`low_thr`**, **`high_thr`**, **`init_thr`**: Thresholds used for testing the tracking system. **Keep, but do not change unless you know what you are doing.**
- **`testing_video_paths`** / **`testing_gt_paths`**: Lists of paths to test videos and their corresponding MOT-formatted ground-truth files. Keep both lists the same length and order so each video aligns with its ground truth. **Note** Quantitative evaluation is helpful but not required. For many use cases, a quick qualitative review of tracker outputs on separate/held-out footage is sufficient.

## 🎬 4. Action Recognition

### 4.0 Runtime (inference)

- **`mart_checkpoint`**: Path to your MART checkpoint.
